The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain how we handle personal information to ensure its confidentiality, security and accuracy.\n  label WHAT IS “PERSONAL INFORMATION”?\n  p “Personal information” is information about an identifiable individual. It includes contact information such as your name, address, phone number and financial information.\n  label HOW DO WE OBTAIN YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND WHAT DO WE OBTAIN?\n  p We obtain the information that you choose to give us. You may do so in a variety of ways including:\n    ul\n      li When you visit our website for the purpose of becoming involved with the platform as a volunteer\n      li When you subscribe to our communications\n      li If you donate or make a contribution to the platform\n      li If you register at an event or a community meeting\n      li If you complete any other form on the Imagine X website, including online petitions or surveys\n  p It is also possible that your information could be provided to us by a volunteer or friend who thinks you would be interested in getting involved with Imagine X.\n  p The information that we collect may include:\n    ul\n      li Contact and identification information, such as your name, address, telephone numbers, e-mail address and social media contacts.\n      li Financial information that we need to process donations e.g. payment methods and preferences, billing and banking information (e.g. credit card number and expiry date).\n  label HOW DO WE USE AND SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?\n  p We will not, without your consent, use your personal information for any purpose other than as described in this privacy policy, except where permitted or required by applicable legislation.\n  p We also use your personal information to communicate with you about Imagine X and its activities, as well as to provide you with news and information. We use your financial information to process your contributions. If you have been a contributor, we may contact you again to seek your financial support. Under no circumstances, however, do we sell your personal information.\n  p We may engage third party providers to perform tasks on our behalf such as processing your donation, making phone calls and providing technical services to our website. When information is shared with third parties for these purposes, we include privacy protective clauses in written contracts to help safeguard personal information.\n  label HOW DO WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?\n  p The security of your personal information is important to us. For information provided online, our website contains security measures in order to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control.\n  label HOW CAN I UPDATE MY INFORMATION OR UNSUBSCRIBE?\n  p You may update or correct the information you provide to us by e-mailing us at hello@imaginex.ca. If you have subscribed to receive information, you may unsubscribe by clicking “Unsubscribe” at the bottom of the email message.\n  label WHAT ABOUT ANTI-SPAM LEGISLATION?\n  p Most of the messages sent by the Imagine X and other political entities are exempt from the application of Canada’s anti-spam law as it relates to commercial electronic messages sent to electronic addresses. This is because: the electronic messages that we send are generally either those soliciting donations, which are specifically exempt under the law, or are messages of an informational, not a commercial, character. If we do send any messages to which the law applies and for which there are no exemptions, we will ensure that we have consent to do so, as required by the law, and that any other legal requirements e.g. an unsubscribe mechanism, are met.\n  p As a best practice, we have an unsubscribe mechanism for our electronic messages, even where the law does not require us to do so.\n  label DOES IMAGINE X LOG IP ADDRESSES?\n  p We log IP addresses, or the location of your computer network on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We may also use IP addresses to track which pages people visit in order to improve the quality of our website.\n  label DOES IMAGINE X USE COOKIES?\n  p Like many websites, we use cookies which are small text files stored on the user’s browser. We use cookies to, for example, assist with site traffic analysis which includes tracking the time and date of website visits, pages viewed and referring URL’s. There are simple ways to refuse cookies, or accept them each time they are offered. Consult your browser’s online help for assistance on changing cookie settings or removing cookie files.\n  label LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES\n  p Our website contains links to a limited number of other websites including those for our provincial and territorial associations. Imagine X is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of these websites.\n  label CONTACT US\n  p If you have any questions about our privacy policy or the information you have provided to us online, simply email us at hello@imaginex.ca.\n  button.btn--full(@click.prevent='closeModal') OK\n\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport Modal from '../utils/Modal.vue'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    Modal\n  },\n  computed: {\n    visible() {\n      return this.$store.state.director.privacy\n    },\n  },\n  methods: {\n    closeModal() {\n      this.$store.dispatch('TOGGLE_PRIVACY')\n    },\n  },\n}\n</script>\n\n<style lang='stylus' scoped>\n\n@import \"../../styles/main\"\n\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Privacy.vue?53288465","<template lang=\"jade\">\n\ndiv.sources(v-show='!!content.length')\n    h6 SOURCES\n    div.sources__container(v-for='(link, index) in content')\n      p.source(\n        target=\"_blank\",\n          :style='style'\n          ) [{{index + 1}}] {{link}}\n\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  props:['content', 'color'],\n  computed: {\n    style(){\n      return {\n        color: this.color\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n</script>\n\n<style lang=\"stylus\" scoped>\n  @import \"../../styles/main\"\n\n  .source\n    font-size:.7em\n\n  .sources__container\n    line-height: 1.6rem;\n\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Sources.vue?a74f6c96","<template>\n  <Modal v-bind:visible=\"visible\" v-bind:close=\"closeModal\" v-bind:sm=\"true\">\n    <h1>Terms of Use Agreement</h1>\n    <p>Please read these Terms of Use (\"Terms\") carefully before using the <router-link to=\"/home\">www.imagine-x.ca</router-link> website and Imagine X Apps (the \"Service\") operated by Imagine X and its participants.</p>\n    <p>The apps that Imagine X operates includes but not limited to:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>MLA Voting Records App</li>\n      <li>Nominate a Candidate App</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>The Service contains information, web pages, materials and hypertext links to websites that are of interest to Imagine X and the general public (the “Content”).

MLA voting records web app shows that B.C. legislature is deeply politically polarized</h3>\n            <p><i>Citizen political group, Imagine X launches new interactive app for public to discover MLA voting records</i></p>\n            <p>December 7, 2016 (VANCOUVER, BC) - Imagine X, a political group in B.C., today announces the release of the first ever B.C. MLA voting records web application viewable at <a href=\"/votes\">www.imagine-x.ca/votes</a>. The interactive app tracks and visualizes voting data from the most recent provincial parliament to illustrate the stark partisan divide in the B.C. legislature. This is the first time that B.C. MLA voting records are displayed in an accessible and meaningful way for the public to consume.</p>\n            <p>The app consists of data aggregated from 109 standing votes in the first to fifth sessions of the 40th provincial parliament from 2013 to 2016 as recorded by the Hansard provided by the Legislative Assembly of B.C. Outside of two isolated incidents, the voting records consistently demonstrate that MLAs from the B.C. Liberal and B.C. NDP caucuses are “whipped” - meaning that the majority of their votes seem strongly influenced by party discipline over constituency interests. As Sean Holman highlighted in his documentary, <i>Whipped: the secret world of party discipline</i>, MLAs can face severe internal and external consequences for voting against their party even when it is in their constituency’s best interests to do so. In contrast, independent members of legislature, such as Vicki Huntington of Delta-South, can exercise “free” votes that are inline with their constituency’s interests and own consciences, while balanced against the best interests of all British Columbians.</p>\n            <p>Starting today, anyone can submit new nominees and endorse existing nominees on the website. Nominees must not already be affiliated with an existing political party. Submissions do not reflect the electoral intentions of the person nominated or the stage of their official nomination with Elections BC. The intention of this website is solely to facilitate a dialogue with the general public to encourage more people to participate in British Columbia’s democracy by running for a seat in the legislature.</p>\n            <p>British Columbians will go to the polls next May with the hope of electing representatives who will be their voices in the legislature in Victoria. However, based on historical data, unknowing British Columbians will more likely be voting MLAs who will be representing party politics in Victoria back to them. The strength of party discipline in B.C. has created a divisive parliamentary environment that does not encourage independent thought or a citizen-centric representative democracy. As Premier W.A.C. Bennett once said “...the time has now arrived in British Columbia when members must be elected to represent constituencies and not to be party rubber stamps and jump through the hoop at the crack of the party whip in Victoria.”</p>\n            <p>Over the next few months leading up to the next provincial election, Imagine X will be releasing series of initiatives that will continue to highlight and challenge the partisan polarization in B.C. politics.</p>\n            <b>Quotes</b>\n            <b>Fred Bantados, Spokesperson for Imagine X</b>\n            <p>“As Imagine X, we want to bring public awareness to the political divisiveness and lack of independent thought in the B.C. legislature. Creating this MLA voting records app is one of our first steps. We think that accessible voting records of B.C. MLAs displayed in a meaningful way for the public to consume is vital to a healthy and transparent democracy. The data clearly shows that our current MLAs usually only vote along the party lines above all else. We need to reimagine politics and rethink how we can bring democracy back to the people in B.C.”</p>\n            <b>Sean Holman, Documentary Filmmaker of <i>Whipped: the secret world of party discipline</i></b>\n            <p>“Most MLAs will only ever vote and voice the party line, giving a government with a majority in the legislature the power to do whatever it wants between elections. That’s not much of a democracy, something I illustrated in my 2013 documentary, Whipped: the secret world of party discipline. As this project from Imagine X shows, not much has changed since then. But, if British Columbians do want such a change, they need to be thinking about how to elect more MLAs who will actually listen to them and their own conscience.”</p>\n            <b>Quick Facts</b>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Data analysed is from 109 standing votes recorded in the first to fifth session of the 40th Parliament of the Legislative Assembly of B.C. from July 2013 to July 2016.</li>\n                <li>In the period analysed, only 1.8% (two votes) were cast out of party lines by a total five MLAs from the B.C.
